# Weather App
Weather is a simple app that displays weather in SwiftUI.
I was using MVVM Design Pattern to create it.
Also I've used Lottie animation for weather icons, you have to install Lottie using SPM or Cocoa Pods.
If you want to create your own app like this you have to log in on "https://api.openweathermap.org" and get your API key.
So enjoy to test it and good luck!)
